This project focuses on leveraging Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) for Handwritten Digit Classification. The main objective is to train the model to accurately recognize and classify handwritten digits, typically ranging from 0 to 9. Through the training process on labeled datasets, the ANN learns intricate patterns, enabling it to generalize its understanding and make precise predictions on unseen handwritten digit images. The workflow includes dataset preparation, model training, evaluation on separate sets, and using the trained model for predicting new digits.
